# 🚀 Deepfake Face Detection Using LSTM 🌟

As technology continues to advance, deepfake face manipulation has emerged as a significant security concern, threatening digital integrity and authenticity. To combat this growing issue, I developed a **cutting-edge solution** that leverages **Machine Learning** for detecting deepfake images and videos with remarkable precision and efficiency.

## 📌 Project Overview

### 🔍 Image Analysis:
For analyzing static images, I harnessed the robust capabilities of the **Xception Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. This architecture is particularly adept at identifying subtle, manipulated features in facial data, ensuring reliable detection of deepfakes.

### 📹 Video Analysis:
For videos, I implemented **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks. By leveraging LSTM's sequential learning capabilities, my solution identifies deepfake content by evaluating temporal inconsistencies and subtle manipulations across video frames. This dual-technique approach provides a comprehensive defense mechanism.

### 🌟 Highlights:
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines CNN for static image detection and LSTM for dynamic video sequence evaluation.
- **Efficiency**: The architecture is designed to detect deepfakes with high accuracy, maintaining speed and scalability.
- **Real-World Applicability**: Proactively defends against digital deception and helps ensure a trustworthy online environment.

## 🚧 Repository Limitation and Solution

### Codebase:
Due to the extensive size of the codebase (over 1 GB), which exceeds GitHub's limit of 100 MB, the repository cannot host the entire project. Instead, the codebase is hosted on **Google Drive** for accessibility.

### Demonstration:
To see the project in action, I have shared a detailed video demonstration on **LinkedIn**, showcasing its functionality and performance:
